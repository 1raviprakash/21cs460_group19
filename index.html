    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Our goal is to predict different quantities like average monthly temperature,rainfall of different location   </li>

        <li> We will be using time series forecast method.   </li>

        <li> We will try to  do some changes or/and add something  to these  time series forecast method to improve the forecast.   </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Time Series</h2>
    <p> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence of observation taken at successive <br/> equally spaced points in time.
                e.g Daily Max and Min Temperature record
            </li>
    
            <li>Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.    </li>
    
            <li>Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.    </li>
    
            
    
    
    
        </ul>
     </p>

    <h2>Models:</h2>
    <p> 
        <ul>
            <li>  Auto regressive (AR) Model  </li>
    
            <li> Integrated (I) Model   </li>
    
            <li>  Moving average(MR) Model   </li>
    
            <li>  Combination of these: autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models </li>
            <li>ARIMAX  </li>
            <li>SARIMA </li>
            <li>SARIMAX  </li>

    <h2>ARIMA Model:</h2>
    <p>  
        <ul>
            <li>AR MODEL AR(p): we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of predictors. In an autoregression model, we forecast the <br/> 
		    variable of interest using a linear combination of past values of the variable.
              <br/>    <img src="eqn1.png" alt="Work Flow">  </li> <br/>
    
            <li>MA model MA(q):-Rather than using past values of the forecast variable in a regressio  n, a moving average model uses past forecast errors. <br/>

        </ul>
    </p>

    

    <h3>ARIMA : </h3>
    <p>  
        An ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p, d, q
It is basically a combination of previous mentioned model
where,<br/>

p is the order of the AR term.<br/>

q is the order of the MA term.<br/>

d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary.<br/>

If a time series, has seasonal patterns, then you need to add seasonal terms and it becomes SARIMA, short for ‘Seasonal ARIMA’.

    <h2>Challenge:</h2>
    <p>  
        <ul>
            <li> SARIMAX and ARIMAX uses Exogenous variable(X) on which our prediction may depend. We are thinking to add some more Exogenous variables to our model.   </li>
    
            <li>In case of weather forecast just a time evolution of a place cannot give us a good result.We are thinking of adding information about surrounding places <br/> to it as well. The major problem will be showing the connection between the places. We would like to make a model for a place so that it is coupled to surrounding places.    </li>

    <h2>Plan:</h2>
    <p>  
        <ul>
            <li> UPTO MIDSEM  </li>
    
            <li>We want study these Model in detail and use it (with python libraries) to predict maximum and minimum temperatures of selected local areas where we have the data.    </li>
    
            <li> We would like  to make experiments with the Exogenous variables (X) of SARIMAX and ARIMAX model to improve the forecast.    </li>
    
            <li>POST MIDSEM</li>
            <li>
                we will be thinking about some ways to tackle the above mentioned challenge
                and try to do the forecast in short time scale.
