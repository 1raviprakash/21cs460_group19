    <h2>Review of Research Papers That we read for our project:</h2>
    <p>
       <ul> 
          <li>  PAPER 1:
                ARIMA based daily weather forecasting tool: A case study for Varanasi,
                by -  NIKITA SHIVHARE, ATUL KUMAR RAHUL, SHYAM BIHARI DWIVEDI and
                PRABHAT KUMAR SINGH DIKSHIT.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Varanasi:65  Years  of  daily  meteorological  data  (rainfall,mintemp ,max temp) from IMD
                </li>


                <li>(1951-1995):Training  set  ,monitoring.(1995-2015)validatingset,testing</li>

                <li>They worked out ARIMA(2,0,2) for rainfall and ARIMA(2,1,3) for temperature data.With root mean squared
                error  values  0.0948  and  0.085  for  rainfall  data  and temperature  data  respectively.
                This  accuray shows  that  their algorithm worked successfully.</li>

              PAPER 2: Time series analysis of climate variables using seasonal
              ARIMA approach, by -TRIPTI DIMRI , SHAMSHAD AHMAD and MOHAMMAD SHARIF
              <a href="https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jess/129/0149">link</a>

              <ul>
                  <li>Time    series    and    seasonal    analysis    of    monthly    mean minimum  and  maximum 
                  Temperature  and  the  precipitation for Bhagirathi River basin(Uttarkashi and Teheri)</li>

                  <li>Box  -jenkins  approach  to  find  a  good  model  for  forecasting</li>

                  <img src="Paper2flow.png" alt="Flow chart for paper 2" style="width:60%">

                  <li>Their result :for-Precipitation :SARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1,12) and for
                  Temperature:SARIMA(0,1,0)(0,1,1,12)</li>

                  <li>The   forecast   result   for   precipitation   were   found   to   overpredict  for  extreme  rainfall  
                  events(For  both  Below  and  above normal precipitation). That's why they got high RMSE even thoughin  normal  rainfall  
                  days  the  forecast  and  observed  data  do agree.</li>

                  <li>Forecast result for temperature in good agreement.
                  Increasingtrend  for  Teheri  station(767  m)  and  Decreasing  trend  for Uttarkashi station(1071 m).</li>

              PAPER 3: Forecasting daily meteorological time series using ARIMA and regression models,

                  <li>Box-Jenkins approach.</li>
                  <li>ARIMA with an external regressors in the form of Fourier Terms.
                  These would allow seasonal parameters to added to the Data.The Model looks like as follows:ARIMAF(p,d,q)[K]</li>

    <h2>Stationarity of data And its Importance:</h2>
    <p> 
        Stationarity is a statistical property
        <ul>
            <li>
                Constant mean  </li>

            <li>
                Constant Variance
            </li>

            <li>No Seasonality
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Repeating trend or pattern over time   </li>
            </ul>

        </ul>

    </p>
    <p> 
        To convert a Non-Stationary Data into Stationary.There are different ways to kill Non-Stationarity of different types.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Differencing , when Y(t) is following a linear trend.Y(t)=Y(t)-Y(t-1)

            </li>   
            <li>
                Sometime we need to do multiple time Differencing.
            </li>

            <li>Sometimes we take Y(t)=LOG(Y(t)) in case where Y(t) is ofexponential type forms.
            </li>
            
            <li> Seasonal differencing Y(t)=Y(t)-Y(t-1)</li>
